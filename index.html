      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I'm a 28-year-old slacker whose primary interest with this bootcamp is to take years of playing with computers and turn it into an even more marketable set of skills than what I have now!</p>
      <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Northern Colorado. I always to move to somewhere far, far away... but I've just never been able to escape my hometown of Fort Collins.</p>
      <h2>What are your interests?</h2>
      <p>In no particular order:</p>
        <ul><li><b>My god, Salem —</b> Originally this was just a mistype of "dog", but I decided to keep it because, well, she certainly thinks she is</li>
        <li><b>Reading —</b> I'm part of a couple different book clubs that I (mostly) keep on top of!</li>
        <li><b>Writing —</b> My first career-oriented position was as a copywriter for an agency in my hometown, and I'm also an aspiring novelist, although these days I seem to have more ideas than work ethic</li>
        <li><b>Video Games —</b> What can I say except that I'm a nerd at heart.</li></ul>
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>Honestly, I loved (and was pretty dang good at) copywriting. Partially because writing for myself is something I'm so passionate about, though, I decided that going into marketing full-time would probably kill my love for the activity if that's all I did all day, every day, without being able to indulge in projects of my own. So I looked for alternatives. I almost went with IT, but I'm better with software than I am with hardware or people, so I ended up here.</p>
      <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
      <p>Right next to one of the best pizza shops in FoCo. It's been absolutely terrible for my wallet and scale.</p>
      <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
      <p>I taught myself how to build websites in WordPress, but my capabilities are still pretty limited. I'm wanting to increase those, and hopefully move onto some more intensive coding using languages like Python, C#, and Java.</p>
